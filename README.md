# Tomorrow Night Bright

This is a VS Code theme based on my own VIM color scheme, "Tomorrow Night Bright", which is itself based on the "Tomorrow Night" color scheme by Chris Kempson. You should be able to simply checkout a copy of this repository, copy the directory into your VS Code extensions directory, and install/enable it in VS Code.
